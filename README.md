# AI Bots Projects and Prompt Engineering 

## Overview

This repository contains projects developed as part of the "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers" course by DeepLearning.AI . The course covers various principles and techniques of prompt engineering with ChatGPT, including prompting principles, iterative prompt development, inferring, expanding, summarizing, and chat format. Additionally, it includes the implementation of three different AI bots: CountryInfoBot, OrderBot, and JokeBot.

## Course Contents

### Prompt Engineering
- **Prompting Principles**: Understanding the fundamental principles behind crafting effective prompts for ChatGPT.
- **Iterative Prompt Development**: Techniques for refining prompts through iterative testing and feedback.
- **Inferring**: Extracting meaningful insights and information from the provided text.
- **Expanding**: Generating detailed and extended content from brief prompts.
- **Summarizing**: Condensing lengthy text into concise summaries.
- **Chat Format**: Structuring interactive and conversational prompts for dynamic dialogues.

## Projects

### CountryInfoBot
CountryInfoBot is an automated service designed to provide detailed information about countries around the world. It greets the user, asks for a country, and then delivers comprehensive information about the specified country, including:
- Capital city
- Population
- Area
- Official languages
- Currency
- Major landmarks
- Brief historical overview
- Interesting facts

### OrderBot
OrderBot is an automated service for collecting pizza orders at a restaurant. The bot:
- Greets the customer
- Collects the order
- Asks if it's for pickup or delivery
- Summarizes the order and confirms any additional items
- Collects delivery address (if needed)
- Processes payment

The bot ensures that all options, extras, and sizes are clarified to identify items from the menu uniquely.

### JokeBot
JokeBot is an automated service designed to entertain users with jokes. It:
- Greets the user
- Offers various joke categories: knock-knock jokes, puns, dad jokes, one-liners, animal jokes, tech jokes, school jokes, and holiday jokes
- Delivers a joke based on the selected category
- Asks if the user wants to hear another joke
- Ends the conversation with a friendly note if the user declines another joke
